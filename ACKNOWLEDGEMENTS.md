## Historical note (upstream maintainer announcement)

The upstream JanBan maintainer announced stepping away from maintenance. Preserved here for context:

"After many years of development and maintenance, I have decided to retire from active development of JanBan. As I no longer use Windows or Office personally, I've been unable to maintain the project for the past few years.

I initially thought I might pick up development again after my retirement, but after consideration, I've decided not to purchase Windows and Office licenses or set up a new development environment specifically for this purpose.

What this means:
- The repository has been migrated from GitLab to GitHub to increase visibility
- No new features will be implemented by me
- I will not be able to respond to support requests
- The application is stable in its current state with no major known issues

For users: Thank you for your interest and support over the years. The current version should continue to work as is.

For developers: This project is now open for adoption! Feel free to fork the repository, make improvements, or use it as a foundation for a new version."
